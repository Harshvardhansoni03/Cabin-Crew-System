verilog project whhich is done using digital electronics and FSM

Design and development of ASIC for Crew Cabin Lighting
Description of the Problem:	The ASIC provides programmable functionality for crew cabin LED lighting system, enabling it to read and operate non-lit panels and controls. This system will utilize processor based controls to manage both the lighting and the interaction with the non-lit panels. The ASIC will provide following functionalities: Provide visibility controls with help of multiple channels of LEDs. UART/SPI/I2C based communication. ADC and GPIO channels for analog and digital inputs respectively. Brightness and Colour management controls to provide adequate cabin illumination for in-flight video capture. Interface- UART , Power Management, ADC, GPIO, touchscreen panel No of LED control ? 10(Minimum ) Radiation Mitigation- Single Event Effect Mitigation techniques.
